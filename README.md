        Jeffery puts a ton of images on his github repo thinking he will get more followers, Jeffery is the type of programmer who codes for clout, he goes through other developer's profile just to see how they are doing, Jeffery is a victim of Imposter syndrome, "*but.. but.. more likes means I'm a good dev*". The moment Jeffery gets free time he starts working on another shity project. No one likes to hire Jeffery because of his attitude. Jeffery is the kind of dev who tells everyone on Discord about how good of a dev he is, while the only language he knows is Javascript, Jeffery never tries to learn new programming languages.
